FireFrame Loader Base 

- I'm making this public, since developing this would take a lot of time and probably wouldn't be worth it.

What's included:

Fully working dashboard (except user group management system)
Fully working loader API (without module streaming)

What needs to be done to make this a fully functional loader:

- Write your loader to work with the API
- Write module streaming
- Write a server mapper (process imports and reallocations on server) - optional

- NOTE: This isn't going to be a fully secure loader from the start, you still need to account for a lot of things.
